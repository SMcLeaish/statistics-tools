# Statistics Tools

### A collection of jupyter notebooks created for a statistics course.

The notebooks are in many cases designed to solve a specific problem, 
and are not necessarily designed to be reusable. However, they can be 
used as a reference for similar problems.

I intend to try and make them more generalized in the future.
